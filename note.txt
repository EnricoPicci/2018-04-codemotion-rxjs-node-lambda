Install webpack and serverless-webpack plugin
    "npm install webpack --save-dev"
    "npm install serverless-webpack --save-dev"
    "npm install ts-loader --save-dev"  (currently the version supported of ts-loader is 3.5.0 and not the 4.x.x)

in serverless.yml insert the following lines
package:
  individually: true
plugins:
  - serverless-webpack

NOTE: the "serverless-webpack" plugin is not compatible with the "serverless-plugin-typescript" plugin



create a webpack.config.js file in the root directory

build and deploy with the command "serverless deploy"

in case the build fails with message "The webpack plugin could not find the configuration file at: .../.build/webpack.config.js
just copy webpack.config.js in the .build directory -- THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE "serverless-plugin-typescript" plugin
